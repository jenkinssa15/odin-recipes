    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The chocolate chip cookie was invented in the United States of America around 1938.</p>
        
        <p>It was invented by <strong>Ruth Graves Wakefield</strong>, when she chopped up a Nestlé semi-sweet chocolate bar and added the chopped chocolate to a cookie recipe.</p>
        
        <p>The original recipe was called <em>Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookies</em>.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

                 <li>Put 150g softened salted butter, 80g light brown muscovado sugar and 80g granulated sugar into a bowl and beat until creamy.</li>
